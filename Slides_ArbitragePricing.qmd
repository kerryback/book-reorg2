# Introduction

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

- Explain the concept of linear pricing and its implications
- Calculate state prices and risk-neutral probabilities
- Apply the fundamental pricing formula with different numeraires
- Understand how probability measures change under different numeraires
- Value derivatives using arbitrage-free pricing methods

## Why Study Arbitrage Pricing?

**Key Insight:** Most of modern finance rests on one simple principle:

> *There are no free lunches in well-functioning markets*

. . .

This principle leads to:

- Black-Scholes formula
- Risk-neutral valuation
- Change of numeraire techniques
- Martingale pricing methods

# Linear Pricing

## The Fundamental Concept

**Linear Pricing** is the cornerstone of asset pricing theory

. . .

Think of buying fruit:

- 5 apples + 6 oranges = 5 × (price of apple) + 6 × (price of orange)

. . .

In finance:

- Price of portfolio = sum of (quantity × price) for each asset
- This applies to **contingent claims** (payoffs in different states)

## No Arbitrage Implies Linear Pricing

**Definition:** An arbitrage opportunity is a trading strategy with:

- Non-negative cash flows in all states
- Strictly positive cash flow in at least one state

. . .

**Key Result:** If there are no arbitrage opportunities, then the pricing operator is linear:

$$P(aX + bY) = aP(X) + bP(Y)$$

## State Prices

If pricing is linear, it must have the form:

$$P(X) = \sum_{j=1}^J \pi_j X_j$$

. . .

where:

- $\pi_j$ = **state price** (price of \$1 in state $j$)
- $X_j$ = payoff in state $j$
- State prices are **strictly positive** (no arbitrage)

. . .

**Time Value of Money:**
$$1 = \sum_{j=1}^J \pi_j e^{rt}$$

# Binomial Model

## State Prices in the Binomial Model

Two states (up and down), two equations:

\begin{align*}
1 &= \pi_u e^{rt} + \pi_d e^{rt} \\
S &= \pi_u S_u + \pi_d S_d
\end{align*}

. . .

**Solution:**
$$\pi_u  = \frac{S-e^{-rt}S_d}{S_u - S_d}, \quad \pi_d = \frac{e^{-rt}S_u-S}{S_u - S_d}$$

. . .

**No-arbitrage condition:** $\pi_u, \pi_d > 0$ requires:
$$\frac{S_u}{S} > e^{rt} > \frac{S_d}{S}$$

## Arrow Securities

**Definition:** An Arrow security pays \$1 in one specific state, \$0 otherwise

. . .

In the binomial model:

- $\pi_u$ = price of Arrow security for "up" state
- $\pi_d$ = price of Arrow security for "down" state

. . .

**Any derivative** can be decomposed as a portfolio of Arrow securities:
$$C = \pi_u C_u + \pi_d C_d$$

## Risk-Neutral Probabilities

Define: $p_u = \pi_u e^{rt}$ and $p_d = \pi_d e^{rt}$

. . .

Properties:

- $p_u + p_d = 1$ and both are positive
- Can be interpreted as **probabilities**

. . .

**Derivative pricing formula:**
$$C = e^{-rt}[p_u C_u + p_d C_d] = e^{-rt}\mathbb{E}^R[C]$$

where $\mathbb{E}^R$ is the expectation under risk-neutral probabilities

## Risk-Neutral Probability Formula

$$p_u = \frac{e^{rt} - S_d/S}{S_u/S - S_d/S}$$

. . .

**Key Insight:** The risk-neutral probability is:

- Not the "real" probability
- The probability that makes the expected return equal to $r$
- A mathematical tool for pricing

. . .

**Verification:**
$$\mathbb{E}^R[S_T] = p_u S_u + p_d S_d = S e^{rt}$$

# Multiple States

## Generalizing to $J$ States

With $J$ possible states at time $t$, we need $J$ equations:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
e^{rt} & e^{rt} & \cdots & e^{rt} \\
S_1^{(1)} & S_2^{(1)} & \cdots & S_J^{(1)} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
S_1^{(J-1)} & S_2^{(J-1)} & \cdots & S_J^{(J-1)}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\pi_1 \\ \pi_2 \\ \vdots \\ \pi_J
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ S^{(1)} \\ \vdots \\ S^{(J-1)}
\end{bmatrix}$$

. . .

Need $J$ traded assets with linearly independent payoffs

## Valuation with State Prices

Once we have state prices:

$$V = \sum_{j=1}^J \pi_j V_j$$

. . .

Or equivalently with risk-neutral probabilities ($p_j = \pi_j e^{rt}$):

$$V = e^{-rt} \sum_{j=1}^J p_j V_j = e^{-rt} \mathbb{E}^p[V_t]$$

# Continuous Time

## Stochastic Discount Factor

In continuous time with infinitely many states:

::: {.block}
### Fundamental Principle
If there are no arbitrage opportunities, there exists a strictly positive random variable $m_t$ (stochastic discount factor) such that:

$$P_0 = \mathbb{E}[m_t P_t]$$
:::

. . .

The stochastic discount factor generalizes state prices:

- For finite states: $m_t = \pi_j/\text{prob}_j$ in state $j$
- Prices all assets consistently

## Risk-Neutral Measure in Continuous Time

The risk-free asset satisfies: $1 = \mathbb{E}[m_t e^{rt}]$

. . .

This means $m_t e^{rt}$ has expectation 1, so we can define:

$$\mathbb{E}^R[Z] = \mathbb{E}[m_t e^{rt} Z]$$

. . .

**Result:** Under the risk-neutral measure $\mathbb{P}^R$:

$$P_0 = e^{-rt} \mathbb{E}^R[P_t]$$

Price = discounted expected payoff under risk-neutral measure

## Martingale Property

**Definition:** A martingale is a process where:
$$\mathbb{E}_s[X_t] = X_s \text{ for all } s < t$$

. . .

**Key Result:** Discounted asset prices are martingales under the risk-neutral measure:

$$\frac{X(0)}{R(0)} = \mathbb{E}^R\left[\frac{X_t}{R_t}\right]$$

where $R_t = e^{rt}$

# Change of Numeraire

## Why Change Numeraire?

Our choice of the risk-free asset as numeraire was **arbitrary**

. . .

**Key Insight:** Any strictly positive traded asset can serve as numeraire

. . .

Benefits of changing numeraire:

- Simplifies certain calculations
- Provides different perspectives on the same problem
- Essential for pricing certain exotic options

## Defining New Probability Measures

For a dividend-reinvested asset $Y$ with strictly positive value:

$$Y(0) = \mathbb{E}[m_t Y_t]$$

. . .

Define new probabilities using $Y$ as numeraire:

$$\text{prob}^Y_s = \frac{\mathbb{E}[m_t Y_t \mathbf{1}_{\{s\}}]}{Y(0)}$$

. . .

Then any asset price satisfies:

$$S(0) = Y(0) \mathbb{E}^Y\left[\frac{S_t}{Y_t}\right]$$

## Fundamental Pricing Formula

::: {.block}
### The Fundamental Formula

For any two dividend-reinvested assets $P$ and $Y$:

$$Y_s = P_s \mathbb{E}^P_s \left[\frac{Y_t}{P_t}\right]$$

for all times $s < t$
:::

. . .

**Interpretation:**

- The ratio $Y_t/P_t$ is a martingale under the $P$-numeraire measure
- Price of $Y$ at time $s$ = price of $P$ times expected ratio

## Special Cases

**When $P$ is the risk-free asset:**
$$Y_s = e^{-r(t-s)} \mathbb{E}^R_s[Y_t]$$

This is the usual risk-neutral pricing formula

. . .

**When $P$ is the stock $S$:**
$$V_0 = S_0 \mathbb{E}^S\left[\frac{V_T}{S_T}\right]$$

Useful for pricing options with payoffs relative to stock price

# Stock as Numeraire

## Stock Numeraire in Binomial Model

Define probabilities using stock as numeraire:

$$\text{prob}^S_u = \frac{\pi_u S_u}{S}, \quad \text{prob}^S_d = \frac{\pi_d S_d}{S}$$

. . .

These are valid probabilities ($> 0$ and sum to 1)

. . .

For a call option:
$$\frac{C}{S} = \text{prob}^S_u \frac{C_u}{S_u} + \text{prob}^S_d \frac{C_d}{S_d}$$

The ratio $C/S$ is a martingale under stock numeraire

## Stock Numeraire in Continuous Time

For geometric Brownian motion, under different measures:

. . .

**Risk-neutral measure ($\mathbb{P}^R$):**
$$\frac{dS}{S} = (r-q) dt + \sigma dB^R$$

. . .

**Stock numeraire measure ($\mathbb{P}^S$):**
$$\frac{dS}{S} = (r-q+\sigma^2) dt + \sigma dB^S$$

. . .

**Key difference:** Drift increases by $\sigma^2$ when using stock as numeraire

# Girsanov's Theorem

## Changing Probability Measures

When we change probability measures:

- A process that was a Brownian motion **may not remain** a Brownian motion
- It becomes an Ito process with **different drift**
- The **diffusion coefficient** (volatility) **remains unchanged**

. . .

**Intuition:**

- Changing probabilities changes expected movements (drift)
- But doesn't change how much paths "wiggle" (volatility)

## Example: From Actual to Risk-Neutral

Under the actual probability measure $\mathbb{P}$:
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}S}{S} = \mu \mathrm{d}t + \sigma \mathrm{d}B$$

where $B$ is a Brownian motion

. . .

Under the risk-neutral measure $\mathbb{P}^R$:
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}S}{S} = r \mathrm{d}t + \sigma \mathrm{d}B^*$$

where $B^*$ is a Brownian motion under $\mathbb{P}^R$

. . .

**Note:** Same volatility $\sigma$, different drift ($\mu \to r$)

# Applications

## Three Ways to Price a Derivative

Consider a European call option with payoff $(S_T - K)^+$

. . .

**Method 1: State Prices**
$$C = \sum_j \pi_j (S_j - K)^+$$

. . .

**Method 2: Risk-Neutral Valuation**
$$C = e^{-rT}\mathbb{E}^R[(S_T - K)^+]$$

. . .

**Method 3: Stock Numeraire**
$$C = S_0 \mathbb{E}^S\left[\frac{(S_T - K)^+}{S_T}\right]$$

All three give the **same answer**!

## When to Use Each Method

**State Prices:**

- Discrete models with few states
- Emphasizes market completeness

. . .

**Risk-Neutral Valuation:**

- Most common in practice
- Natural for Monte Carlo simulation
- Standard for most derivatives

. . .

**Stock Numeraire:**

- Options with payoffs relative to stock price
- Digital options
- Lookback and Asian options

# Key Takeaways

## Summary: The Big Picture

1. **No arbitrage** $\Rightarrow$ **Linear pricing** $\Rightarrow$ **State prices**

2. State prices $\Rightarrow$ **Risk-neutral probabilities**

3. Asset price ratios are **martingales** under appropriate measures

4. **Any positive asset** can serve as numeraire

5. **Fundamental pricing formula:** Values are expectations of discounted payoffs
