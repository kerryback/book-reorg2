The concept of linear pricing is essentially the same as asking for the price of five apples and six oranges. Of course, this is the price of one apple times five plus the price of one orange times six. However, instead of pricing bundles of commodities today, we will find prices of dollars in different contingencies at times in the future.\n\nAn arbitrage opportunity is a trading strategy that produces nonnegative cash flows at all times in all contingencies with a strictly positive cash flow at some time in some contingency. If such an opportunity were to exist, traders would exploit it until prices adjust to eliminate the possibility. Although simple, this has powerful implications.\n\n## Finite States \n\nConsider a world where there are $J$ possible states of the world at time $t$. No arbitrage then implies the following properties:\n\n1. If $X$ and $Y$ are time $t$ random cash flows, the time 0 price of the random cash flow $aX+bY$ is $a$ times the time 0 price of $X$ plus $b$ times the time 0 price of $Y$. If $P(\\cdot)$ is a pricing function that gives us the price of a random cash flow today, then $P(aX+bY)=aP(X) + bP(Y)$. In other words, the pricing operator is linear. This follows because if this fails to hold, there is an arbitrage assuming an agent can buy and sell any quantities at these prices. Because the pricing operator is linear, it must have the form $P(X) = \\sum_{j=1}^J \\pi_j X_j$ where $X_j$ is the random cash flow in state~$j$. We call $\\pi_j$ the price of a dollar at time $t$ in state $j$ or a state price.\n\n2. The price of any positive nonzero random cash flow at time $t$ is strictly positive. Again, this follows from no arbitrage (think how much of an asset paying a positive dividend you would want if it were free or even if you were paid to take the asset). This implies the state prices are strictly positive.\n\n3. The pricing operator obeys time value of money: $1=\\sum_{j=1}^J \\pi_j \\mathrm{e}^{rt}$, where $r$ is the continuously compounded yield to maturity of a bond maturing at $t$. This is the present value rule: the present value of the future value $\\mathrm{e}^{rt}$ is one or, equivalently, the present value of a dollar paid at $t$ is $\\mathrm{e}^{-rt}$.\n\n4. The pricing operator must be consistent with observable prices. The price $S_0$ of a traded asset with random cash flows at time $t$ is given by $S_0= \\sum_{j=1}^J \\pi_j S_j$ where $S_j$ is the random cash flow in state $j$.\n\nWe saw these principles and  calculated state prices in the binomial model ($J=2$ and two assets) in @sec-c:trees.  To calculate state prices for general finite $J$, we need to find $J$ state prices $\\pi_1, \\ldots, \\pi_J$. If we have $J$ traded assets (including the risk-free asset) with linearly independent payoffs, then we can solve:\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} \n\\mathrm{e}^{rt} & \\mathrm{e}^{rt} & \\cdots & \\mathrm{e}^{rt} \\\\\nS_1^{(1)} & S_2^{(1)} & \\cdots & S_J^{(1)} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nS_1^{(J-1)} & S_2^{(J-1)} & \\cdots & S_J^{(J-1)}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\pi_1 \\\\ \\pi_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\pi_J\n\\end{bmatrix} = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\\\ S^{(1)} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ S^{(J-1)}\n\\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nwhere $S^{(i)}$ is the current price of asset $i$ and $S_j^{(i)}$ is its payoff in state $j$.\n\nWith state prices determined, we can calculate the value $V$ of any derivative security with payoffs $V_j$ as:\n\n$$\nV = \\sum_{j=1}^J \\pi_j V_j\\,.\n$$ {#eq-arbpricing-stateprices}\n\nThe risk-neutral probabilities are defined as in @sec-c:trees: $p_j = \\pi_j \\mathrm{e}^{rt}$, giving\n\n$$\nV = \\mathrm{e}^{-rt} \\sum_{j=1}^J p_j V_j = \\mathrm{e}^{-rt} \\mathbb{E}^p[V_t]\\,.\n$$ {#eq-arbpricing-rnp0}\n\nWe call the collection of risk-neutral probabilities $(p_1, \\ldots, p_J)$ the risk-neutral probability measure or, for brevity, the risk-neutral measure.  We also use the term 'risk-neutral measure' to describe the risk-neutral probability distribution when there is a continuum of states.\n\nAnother useful representation of pricing in a finite-state world is obtained by dividing each state price by the probability of the state.  Set $m_j = \\pi_j/\\text{prob}_j$, where $\\text{prob}_j$ denotes the probability of state $j$ (the actual probability, not the risk-neutral probability).  @eq-arbpricing-stateprices can be written as \n$$\nV = \\sum_{j=1}^J \\text{prob}_jm_jV_j\\,.\n$$ {#eq-arbpricing-sdf0}\nThus, the date-0 value $V$ is the expectation (mean) of the random variable with values $m_jV_j$.  \nThe random variable $m$  is called the **stochastic discount factor** or SDF for short.  \n\n## Continuum of States\n\nWe now extend to models where the stock price can take a continuum of values. The formulas for an asset value in the finite-state model generalize to models with a continuum of states.  We begin with the formula in terms of an SDF.\n\nThe SDF formula @eq-arbpricing-sdf0 generalizes to models with a continuum of states, even though individual states have zero probability, making the division $\\pi_j/\\text{prob}_j$ impossible.  In such models, the SDf is sometimes called a **state price density**, the term density having a similar meaning here as it does in the 'probability density function' of a random variable that one encounters in statistics.  The fundamental principle that underlies option valuation is:\n\n::: Principle\nIf there are no arbitrage opportunities,^[The definition of 'arbitrary opportunity' that is required for this statement to be correct is somewhat complex.  See [@back2010] for a survey of work on this question and [@LoewensteinWillard2000] and [@HestonLoewensteinWillard2007].] then there exists for each date $t$ a strictly positive random variable $m_t$, called a stochastic discount factor, such that the date-0 value of any dividend-reinvested asset with price $P$ is:\n\n$$\nP_0 = \\mathbb{E}[m_t P_t]\\,.\n$$ {#eq-arbpricing-sdf1}\n:::\n\nFrom @eq-arbpricing-sdf1, we can construct a risk-neutral measure and apply 'risk-neutral pricing' as in @eq-arbpricing-rnp0.\nFirst, note that the pricing formula @eq-arbpricing-sdf1 applied to the risk-free asset gives:\n\n$$\n1 = \\mathbb{E}[m_t \\mathrm{e}^{rt}]\\,.\n$$ {#eq-arbpricing-mean1}\n\nThis means that $m_t \\mathrm{e}^{rt}$ has expectation 1. We can define a new probability measure by:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}^R[Z] = \\mathbb{E}[m_t \\mathrm{e}^{rt} Z]$$\n\nfor any random variable $Z$. Because $\\mathbb{E}[m_t\\mathrm{e}^{rt}]=1$, \\mathbb{E}^R[1]=1$, which is required for a probability measure.  Under this probability measure:\n\n$$\nP_0 = \\mathrm{e}^{-rt} \\mathbb{E}^R[P_t]\\,.\n$$ {#eq-}\n\n\n## Martingale Pricing\n\nA martingale is a stochastic process for which the expected value of tomorrow's value is today's value. In our framework, discounted values of non-dividend paying trading strategies are martingales under the risk-neutral measure.\n\nIf $X(0)$ is today's value of a portfolio with random payoff $X$ at time $t$:\n\n$$\\frac{X(0)}{R(0)} = \\sum_{s=1}^S p_s \\frac{X_s}{\\mathrm{e}^{rt}} = \\mathbb{E}^R\\left[\\frac{X}{R_t}\\right]$$\n\nwhere $R(0) = 1$ and $R_t = \\mathrm{e}^{rt}$. The ratio of any asset price to the risk-free asset price is a martingale under the risk-neutral measure.\n\n## Change of Numeraire\n\nOur choice of the risk-free asset as numeraire was arbitrary. Any strictly positive non-dividend paying trading strategy can serve as a numeraire.\n\nFor a dividend-reinvested asset $Y$ with strictly positive value:\n\n$$Y(0) = \\mathbb{E}[m_t Y_t]$$\n\nDefine new probabilities by:\n\n$$\\text{prob}^Y_s = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[m_t Y_t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{s\\}}]}{Y(0)}$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{s\\}}$ is the indicator function for state $s$. Then:\n\n$$S(0) = Y(0) \\mathbb{E}^Y\\left[\\frac{S_t}{Y_t}\\right]$$\n\nThe ratio $S_t/Y_t$ is a martingale under the probability measure induced by using $Y$ as numeraire.\n\n#### Fundamental Pricing Formula\n\n::: Principle\nIn the absence of arbitrage opportunities, prices $P$ and $Y$ of dividend-reinvested assets satisfy, for all $s < t$:\n\n$$Y_s = P_s \\mathbb{E}^P_s \\left[\\frac{Y_t}{P_t}\\right]$$\n:::\n\nThis is the fundamental pricing formula. The value at time $s$ of asset $Y$ is the expectation, under the appropriate probability measure, of its value $Y_t$ at time $t$ discounted by the factor $P_s/P_t$.\n\nWhen $P$ is the risk-free asset:\n\n$$Y_s = \\mathrm{e}^{-r(t-s)} \\mathbb{E}^R_s[Y_t]$$\n\n#### Changing Probability Measures\n\nFor continuous distributions, the probability of event $A$ using $S$ as numeraire is:\n\n$$\\text{prob}^S(A) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbf{1}_A m_t \\frac{S_t}{S_0}\\right]$$\n\nThe expectation of any random variable $X$ using $S$ as numeraire is:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}^S[X] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[X m_t \\frac{S_t}{S_0}\\right]$$\n\nDifferent numeraires lead to different probability measures but the same derivative prices.\n\n## Stock as Numeraire\n\nUsing the stock as numeraire is particularly useful for certain derivatives. In the binomial model, define:\n\n$$\\text{prob}^S_u = \\frac{\\pi_u S_u}{S}, \\quad \\text{prob}^S_d = \\frac{\\pi_d S_d}{S}$$\n\nThese sum to 1 and are positive. For a call option:\n\n$$\\frac{C}{S} = \\text{prob}^S_u \\frac{C_u}{S_u} + \\text{prob}^S_d \\frac{C_d}{S_d}$$\n\nThe ratio $C/S$ (number of shares the call is worth) is a martingale under the stock numeraire measure.\n\nIn continuous time, for any derivative $V$ on stock $S$:\n\n$$V_0 = S_0 \\mathbb{E}^S\\left[\\frac{V_T}{S_T}\\right]$$\n\nThis formulation is often convenient for options that depend on the stock price relative to some level.\n\n## Changes of Probability and Girsanov's Theorem\n\nWhen we change probability measures, we cannot expect a process $B$ that was a Brownian motion to remain a Brownian motion. The expected change in a Brownian motion must always be zero, but when we change probabilities, the expected change of $B$ is likely to become nonzero. However, the Brownian motion $B$ will still be an Ito process under the new probability measure.\n\nChanging probabilities only changes the drift of an Ito process—the diffusion coefficient remains unchanged. This is because the diffusion coefficient determines how much each path \"jiggles,\" which is unaffected by changing the probability measure.\n\n#### Example: Risk-Neutral Probability\n\nSuppose the stock price follows:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{S} = \\mu \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\mathrm{d}B$$\n\nwhere $B$ is a Brownian motion under the actual probability measure. Under the risk-neutral measure, the drift must be the risk-free rate $r$:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{S} = r \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\mathrm{d}B^*$$\n\nwhere $B^*$ is a Brownian motion under the risk-neutral probability.\n\n## Girsanov's Theorem in the Black-Scholes Model\n\nTo value digital options, we need to understand changes of probability measures in continuous time. When we change probability measures, a process $B$ that was a Brownian motion cannot be expected to remain a Brownian motion under the new measure. However, Girsanov's Theorem tells us exactly how the drift changes.\n\nIn the Black-Scholes model, the dividend-reinvested stock price, denoted $Y_t$, evolves as\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}Y_t = \\mu Y_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma Y_t \\,\\mathrm{d}B_t\\,.$$\n\nWe can rewrite this as\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}Y_t = r Y_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma Y_t \\,\\mathrm{d}\\left(B_t + \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}t\\right)\\,.$$\n\nDefine $\\kappa = \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}$.  This is called the market price of risk or Sharpe ratio.\n\n::: Principle\n**Girsanov's Theorem**: Define the exponential martingale:\n\n$$Z_t = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa^2 t - \\kappa B_t\\right)\\,.$$\n\nUsing the rule for expectations of lognormal variables, we can see that $\\mathbb{E}[Z_T] = 1$. Under the probability measure defined by:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}^\\kappa[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_T X]$$\n\nfor any function $X$ of $B_t$ ($0 \\leq t \\leq T$), the process $B_t^\\kappa = B_t + \\kappa t$ is a Brownian motion. Moreover, if $M_t$ is a martingale under the new measure, then $Z_t M_t$ is a martingale under the original measure.\n:::\n\nThis theorem tells us how to construct the risk-neutral measure from the original measure. Using Ito's lemma, we can verify that $Z_t \\frac{Y_t}{R_t}$ is indeed a martingale:\n\n$$Z_t \\frac{Y_t}{R_t} = S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma - \\kappa)^2 t + (\\sigma - \\kappa)B_t\\right)\\,.$$\n\nTherefore this is a lognormal random variable and taking expectations gives:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[Z_t \\frac{Y_t}{R_t}\\right] = S_0\\,.$$\n\n\n#### Dividend Reinvested Share as Numeraire\n\nThe dividend reinvested share follows the process\n$$d Y_t = r Y_t dt + \\sigma Y_t d B_t^R \\,.$$\n\n\nWhen using the stock as numeraire, we need the process $\\frac{R_t}{Y_t}$ to be a martingale. Following the analysis using Girsanov's Theorem to find the risk neutral probabilities, we find that under the stock numeraire measure:\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}Y_t = (r + \\sigma^2) Y_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma V_t \\,\\mathrm{d}B_t^Y\\,.$$\n\nwhere $B_t^Y = B_t^R - \\sigma t$ is a Brownian motion under the dividend reinvested stock numeraire measure.  It then follows \n$$\\frac{R_t}{Y_t} = \\frac{R_0}{S_0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 t - \\sigma B_t^Y \\right)\\,, $$\n\nwhich is an exponential martigale.\n\nGirsanov's Theorem will be important in the next chapter where we derive the Black-Scholes formula.\n\n## Exercises\n\n#### Linear Pricing and State Prices\n\n::: {#exr-linear-pricing}\nConsider a market with 3 possible states at time $T = 1$. There are two traded assets:\n- Risk-free bond: pays $\\mathrm{e}^{0.05}$ in all states  \n- Risky asset: pays $(10, 15, 5)$ in states $(1, 2, 3)$ respectively, currently priced at $S_0 = 9$\n\na) Set up the system of equations to find state prices $(\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3)$\nb) Solve for the state prices\nc) Find the risk-neutral probabilities $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$\nd) Price a derivative that pays $(0, 20, 0)$ in the three states\ne) Verify that the risk-neutral expected return on the risky asset equals the risk-free rate\n:::\n\n::: {#exr-arrow-securities}\nIn the three-state model from the previous exercise:\na) What is the price of an Arrow security that pays $1 in state 2 and $0 in states 1 and 3?\nb) Show that any derivative payoff can be written as a portfolio of Arrow securities\nc) Price a \"digital option\" that pays $100 if the risky asset's payoff exceeds $12, and $0 otherwise\nd) Compare this to pricing the same payoff using risk-neutral probabilities\n:::\n\n::: {#exr-no-arbitrage-conditions}\nConsider a two-period binomial model where the stock can go from $S_0 = 100$ to either $S_u = 120$ or $S_d = 80$ in the first period, with risk-free rate $r = 5\\%$ per period.\n\na) Find the no-arbitrage bounds: show that $S_d < S_0 \\mathrm{e}^r < S_u$ must hold\nb) Calculate the risk-neutral probability $p$ for the up move\nc) If the stock goes to $S_u = 120$ in the first period, it can go to $S_{uu} = 144$ or $S_{ud} = 96$ in the second period.
