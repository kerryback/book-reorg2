We saw how linear pricing leads to state prices, risk-neutral probabilities, and the fundamental pricing formula. We also introduced change of numeraire methods, which allow us to compute option values as expectations under different probability measures. In this chapter, we apply these principles to derive and analyze the celebrated Black-Scholes formula for European option pricing.\n\nA fundamental insight is that standard European options can be expressed as combinations of digital options. Understanding this connection provides both theoretical insight and practical computational advantages.\n\nThe Black-Scholes model assumes that the underlying asset pays a constant dividend yield $q \\mathrm{d} t$ (in other words the stock pays the dividend $q S_t \\mathrm{d}t$) and has an ex-dividend price $S$ satisfying\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{S} = (\\mu - q) \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\mathrm{d}B$$\n\nfor a Brownian motion $B$, where $\\sigma$ and $\\mu$ are assumed to be constant. We also assume a constant continuously-compounded risk-free rate $r$.  In this model $\\mathrm{d}S$ represents the capital gain and $q S_t \\mathrm{d}t$ is the dividend portion of the return.\n\n## Digital Options as Building Blocks\n\nBefore deriving the Black-Scholes formula, we need to understand how standard options relate to digital options. A **digital option** (also called binary option) has a discontinuous payoff—it pays a fixed amount if a condition is met, zero otherwise.\n\n#### Two Types of Digitals\n\nConsider a call option with strike $K$ and maturity $T$. Its payoff $(S_T - K)^+$ can be decomposed as:\n\n$$(S_T - K)^+ = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T > K\\}} S_T - K \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T > K\\}}$$\n\nThis reveals that a call option is the difference between two digital options:\n\n1. **Share digital**: Pays $S_T$ when $S_T > K$, zero otherwise\n2. **Cash digital**: Pays $K$ when $S_T > K$, zero otherwise\n\nSimilarly, a put option with payoff $(K - S_T)^+$ can be written as:\n\n$$(K - S_T)^+ = K \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T < K\\}} - \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T < K\\}} S_T$$\n\nThis is $K$ cash digitals minus share digitals, both paying when $S_T < K$.\n\n#### Why This Decomposition Matters Note: Mark Hates this section\n\nThis decomposition is powerful because:\n\n1. **Computational efficiency**: Digital options have closed-form expressions involving only normal probabilities\n2. **Theoretical insight**: It connects discrete payoffs to continuous probability distributions\n3. **Risk management**: Greeks can be computed directly from the normal density function\n4. **Generalization**: The approach extends to exotic options and other underlying processes\n\n## Girsanov's Theorem in the Black-Scholes Model\n\nTo value digital options, we need to understand changes of probability measures in continuous time. When we change probability measures, a process $B$ that was a Brownian motion cannot be expected to remain a Brownian motion under the new measure. However, Girsanov's Theorem tells us exactly how the drift changes.\n\nIn the Black-Scholes model, the dividend-reinvested stock price, denoted $Y_t$ follows:\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}Y_t = \\mu Y_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma Y_t \\mathrm{d}B_t$$\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}Y_t = r Y_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma Y_t \\mathrm{d}\\left(B_t + \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}t\\right)$$\n\nDefine $\\kappa = \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}$, called the market price of risk or Sharpe ratio.\n\n::: Principle\n**Girsanov's Theorem**: Define the exponential martingale:\n\n$$Z_t = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa^2 t - \\kappa B_t\\right)$$\n\nSince $Z_T$ is lognormal, $\\mathbb{E}[Z_T] = 1$. Under the probability measure defined by:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}^\\kappa[Y] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_T X]$$\n\nfor any function $X$ of $B_t$ ($0 \\leq t \\leq T$), the process $B_t^\\kappa = B_t + \\kappa t$ is a Brownian motion. Moreover, if $M_t$ is a martingale under the new measure, then $Z_t M_t$ is a martingale under the original measure.\n:::\n\nThis theorem tells us how to construct the risk-neutral measure from the original measure. Using Ito's lemma, we can verify that $Z_t \\frac{Y_t}{R_t}$ is indeed a martingale:\n\n$$Z_t \\frac{Y_t}{R_t} = S_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma - \\kappa)^2 t + (\\sigma - \\kappa)B_t\\right)$$\n\nTherefore this is a lognormal random variable and taking expectations gives:\n\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[Z_t \\frac{Y_t}{R_t}\\right] = S_0$$\n\n#### Dividend Reinvested Stock as Numeraire\n\nWhen using the stock as numeraire, we need the process $\\frac{R_t}{Y_t}$ to be a martingale. Following similar analysis with Girsanov's Theorem, we find that under the stock numeraire measure:\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}Y_t = (r + \\sigma^2) Y_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma V_t \\mathrm{d}B_t^Y$$\n\nwhere $B_t^Y = B_t^R - \\sigma t$ is a Brownian motion under the dividend reinvested stock numeraire measure.  It then follows \n$$\\frac{R_t}{Y_t} = \\frac{R_0}{S_0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 t - \\sigma B_t^Y \\right) $$\n\nwhich is an exponential martigale.\n\n## Derivation of the Black-Scholes Formula\n\nNow we apply the valuation theory from Chapter 3 (Arbitrage Pricing) and the tail probability calculations from Chapter 2 (Geometric Brownian Motion) to derive the Black-Scholes formula.\n\n#### Cash Digital Options\n\nA cash digital option paying \\$1 when $S_T > K$ has value under the risk-neutral measure:\n\n$$e^{-r(T-t)} \\mathbb{E}_t^R[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T > K\\}}] = e^{-r(T-t)} \\text{prob}^R(S_T > K)$$\n\nUnder the risk-neutral measure, the stock price follows:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}S}{S} = (r - q) \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\mathrm{d}B^R$$\n\nThis means:\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}\\log S = \\left(r - q - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\mathrm{d}B^R$$\n\nFrom Chapter 2, we know this has the solution:\n\n$$S_T = S_t \\exp\\left(\\left(r - q - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right)(T-t) + \\sigma B_{T-t}^R\\right) $$\n\nApplying the tail probability formula from @sec-tailprobs with $\\alpha = r - q - \\sigma^2/2$:\n\n$$\\text{prob}^R(S_T > K) = N(d_2)$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$d_2 = \\frac{\\log(S_t/K) + (r - q - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})(T-t)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}}$$\n\n#### Share Digital Options\n\nFor the share digital paying $S_T \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T > K\\}}$, we use the dividend reinvested stock as numeraire.  We have \n\n$$S_T  = e^{-q T} Y_T $$\ntherefore\n$$\\frac{S_T}{Y_T}  \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T > K\\}} = e^{-q T}  \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T > K\\}}$$\n\n From the change of numeraire theory in Chapter 3:\n\n$$\\text{Value} = Y_t \\mathbb{E}_t^V[e^{-q T} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T > K\\}}] = e^{-q (T-t) } S_t \\cdot \\text{prob}^Y(S_T > K)$$\n\n\n\nUnder the stock numeraire measure:\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}\\log S = \\left(r - q + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}\\right) \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\mathrm{d}B^Y$$\n\nApplying the tail probability formula from @sec-tailprobs with $\\alpha = r - q + \\sigma^2/2$:\n\n$$\\text{prob}^Y(S_T > K) = N(d_1)$$\n\nwhere:\n\n$$d_1 = \\frac{\\log(S_t/K) + (r - q + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2})(T-t)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}} = d_2 + \\sigma\\sqrt{T-t}$$\n\n#### Combining the Results\n\nNow we can derive the Black-Scholes formula by combining our digital option results. A European call option has payoff:\n\n$$(S_T - K)^+ = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T > K\\}} S_T - K \\mathbf{1}_{\\{S_T > K\\}}$$\n\nThe first term is a share digital worth $e^{-q (T-t)}S_t \\cdot \\text{prob}^S(S_T > K) = e^{- q (T-t)} S_t N(d_1)$.\n\nThe second term is $K$ cash digitals worth $K \\cdot e^{-r(T-t)} \\cdot \\text{prob}^R(S_T > K) = K e^{-r(T-t)} N(d_2)$.\n\nWe need $e^{-q(T-t)}$ in front of the share digital to account for dividends not paid to the call holder upon exercise, the call value is:\n\n#### The Black-Scholes Formula\n\nThis derivation shows how the fundamental arbitrage pricing theory leads directly to the Black-Scholes formula. The key steps were:\n\n1. **Linear pricing**: From Chapter 3, any security's value is a linear combination of Arrow securities (digitals)\n2. **Change of numeraire**: Different measures give different probabilities for the same event  \n3. **Tail probabilities**: From Chapter 2, we can compute $\\text{prob}(S_T > K)$ under any measure\n4. **Girsanov's Theorem**: Provides the mathematical foundation for changing measures\n\n::: Rule\nThe value of a European call option is:\n\n$$C(t, S_t) = e^{-q(T-t)} S_t N(d_1) - e^{-r(T-t)} K N(d_2)$$\n\nwhere $d_1$ and $d_2$ are defined above and $N(\\cdot)$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.\n:::\n\nThe value of a European put option is similarily derived as an exercise :\n\n::: Rule\n$$P(t, S_t) = e^{-r(T-t)} K N(-d_2) - e^{-q(T-t)} S_t N(-d_1)$$\n:::\n\nThe call and put values satisfy a put-call parity relationship:\n\n$$e^{-r(T-t)} K + C(t, S_t) = e^{-q(T-t)} S_t + P(t, S_t)$$\n\n\n\n#### Interactive Black-Scholes Explorer\n\nThe following interactive tool allows you to explore how the Black-Scholes formula behaves as you vary the input parameters. You can see how option prices change with stock price, volatility, time to expiration, interest rates, and dividend yields.\n\n::: {#fig-bs-call-put} \n<iframe height=\"800\" width=\"100%\" src=\"https://delicious-britteny-kerrybackapps-c6c2cf93.koyeb.app/\"></iframe>\n\n**Black-Scholes Explorer.** This interactive calculator shows how call and put option prices vary with the underlying parameters. Notice how the option prices change smoothly with the stock price, and observe the effects of time-to-maturity and volatility on option values.\n:::\n\n## Replication and Delta Hedging\n\nThe Black Scholes formula can also be derived from a no-arbitrage argument since we can replicate option payoffs through dynamic trading. Following Merton's argument, we construct a portfolio holding $\\delta_t$ shares of stock and $\\alpha_t$ units of the risk-free asset, with value:\n\n$$W_t = \\alpha_t e^{rt} + \\delta_t S_t$$\n\nFor continuous trading with no cash inflows or outflows:\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}W_t = \\delta_t \\mathrm{d}S_t + \\delta_t q S_t \\mathrm{d}t + \\alpha_t r e^{rt} \\mathrm{d}t$$\n\nIf the option value is $C(t, S_t)$, then by Ito's lemma:\n\n$$\\mathrm{d}C = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} \\mathrm{d}t + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} \\mathrm{d}S + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} \\sigma^2 S^2 \\mathrm{d}t$$\n\nMatching the stochastic terms requires:\n\n$$\\delta_t = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S}$$\n\nThis is the option's delta—the number of shares needed to hedge the option. Matching the drift terms in both expressions\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} \\mu S_t + \\alpha_t r R_t = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} (\\mu-q) S_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2$$\nwhich can be solved to give\n$$ \\alpha_t r R_t=r \\left(W_t -\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} S_t\\right)  = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}-\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} q S_t  + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2$$\nwhich gives the equation\n$$r W_t = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S}(r-q) S_t+\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} \\sigma^2 S_t^2$$\nwith a boundary condition $W_T = (S_T-K)^{+}$.  However, no-arbitrage suggests $W_t = C(t,S_t)$ which gives us the partial differential equation\n$$r C = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S} (r-q) S+\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S^2} \\sigma^2 S^2$$\nwith a boundary condition $C(T,S_T)= (S_T - K)^{+}$.  This is a partial differential equation and a fairly tedious set of calcuations show the Black Scholes formula is a solution (in fact it is the only positive solution).  Close observation of the right hand side we see this is the drift term of Ito expansion for $C$ if we work in the risk-neutral probability.  The right hand side then says in the risk-neutral probability, the call option earns the risk free return.\n\nHowever, there is nothing special about a call option.  The same argument will apply for any European style option.  The only difference is the boundary condition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: Principle\n\nThe price $V(S_t,t)$ of any European derivative with payoff $V(S_T)$ at maturity $T$ must satisfy:\n\n$$r V = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial V }{\\partial S}(r - q)S + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} \\sigma^2 S^2$$\n\nwith boundary condition $V(S_T, T) = V(S_T)$.\n\n:::\n\nThis PDE has several important interpretations:\n\n1. **Risk-neutral expectation**: The solution is $V(t, S_t) = \\mathbb{E}_t^R[e^{-r(T-t)} V(S_T)]$.  This sometimes called the Feynman Kac Theorem.^[See Karatzas and Shreve (1991).]\n2. **Replication**: The portfolio holds $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}$ shares and $V - \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S}S$ in cash\n3. **Hedging condition**: The drift term equals the risk-free return when perfectly hedged\n\nThe Black-Scholes formula satisfies this PDE with the appropriate boundary conditions for calls and puts.\n\n#### Simulating Portfolio Insurance\n\nRecall, that a protective put position buys a put and buys a share and the payoff at the expiration of the put is given by $\\max(K,S_T)$.  The reason for the name protective put is apparent since the position can pay off no less than $K$.  The cost of this insurance is the price of the put.  However, if the put is not traded, we can synthetically replicate this payoff using the prodedure above assuming we can trade continuously.  The basic recipe is to start with inital wealth equal to that for a protective put position: $W_0 = P(0,S_0)+S_0$.  The delta of the protective put position can be calcuated to be the delta of the put plus 1 which is $N(d_1)$, where $d_1$ is calculated at each point in time.  However, in practice we cannot trade continuously.  A simple discrete strategy would rebalance at intervals $\\Delta t$.  The strategy calculates $N(d_1)$ at time 0 and holds $P(0,S_0)+S_0 - N(d_1)S_0$ dollars in the risk free asset and $N(d_1)$ shares of the asset.  Thereafter these holdings are adjusted.  The change in portfolio value over the interval $\\Delta t$ is \n$$\\Delta W= W_{i \\Delta t}- W_{(i-1)\\Delta t} $$\n$$ \n= (P((i-1)\\Delta t,S_{(i-1)\\Delta t})+S_{(i-1)\\Delta t} - N(d_1-)S_{(i-1)\\Delta t})(R_{i\\Delta t}-R_{(i-1)\\Delta t}) + N(d1-)(S_{i\\Delta t}-S_{(i-1)\\Delta t}) \n$$\nwhere $N(d1-)$ is the delta chosen at time $(i-1)\\Delta t$.  The question is if the Black Scoles model is correct, how accurate can a discrete rebalancing scheme be?  This is simulated in the following code:\n\n::: {#06b6bd41 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\n# from bsfunctions import *\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport time\nfrom math import pow, exp, sqrt\nfrom scipy import stats\n# incs = np.genfromtxt('incs.csv',delimiter=\",\",skip_header=1)\ndef blackscholes(S0, K, r, q, sig, T, call = True):\n    '''Calculate option price using B-S formula.\n\n    Args:\n        S0 (num): initial price of underlying asset.\n        K (num): strick price.\n        r (num): risk free rate.\n        q (num): dividend yield\n        sig (num): Black-Scholes volatility.\n        T (num): maturity.\n        call (bool): True returns call price, False returns put price.\n\n    Returns:\n        num\n    '''\n    d1 = (np.log(S0/K) + (r -q + sig**2/2) * T)/(sig*np.sqrt(T))\n    d2 = d1 - sig*np.sqrt(T)\n#     norm = sp.stats.norm\n    norm = stats.norm\n    if call:\n        return np.exp(-q*T)*S0 * norm.cdf(d1,0,1) - K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(d2,0, 1)\n    else:\n        return np.exp(-q*T)*S0 * -norm.cdf(-d1,0,1) + K * np.exp(-r * T) * norm.cdf(-d2,0, 1)\n\ndef blackscholes_delta(S0, K, r, q, sig, T, call = True):\n    '''Calculate option price using B-S formula.\n\n    Args:\n        S0 (num): initial price of underlying asset.\n        K (num): strick price.\n        r (num): risk free rate.\n        q (num): dividend yield\n        sig (num): Black-Scholes volatility.\n        T (num): maturity.\n        call (bool): True returns call price, False returns put price.\n\n    Returns:\n        num\n    '''\n    d1 = (np.log(S0/K) + (r -q + sig**2/2) * T)/(sig*np.sqrt(T))\n    d2 = d1 - sig*np.sqrt(T)\n#     norm = sp.stats.norm\n    norm = stats.norm\n    if type(call) == bool:\n        if call:\n            return np.exp(-q*T)*norm.cdf(d1,0,1)\n        else:\n            return np.exp(-q*T)*norm.cdf(-d1,0,1)\n    else:\n        print(\"Not a valid value for call\")\n\n# parameters\n# number of paths\n# n = incs.shape[1]\nn = 100000\n# number of divisions\n# m = incs.shape[0]\nm = 100\n# interest rate\nr = .1\n# dividend yield\nq=0.0\n# true drift\nmu = .15\n# volatility\nsig = .2\n# Initial Stock Price\nS0 = 42\n# Strike Price\nK = 42\n# Maturity\nT = 0.5\n\n\n# seed for random generator\nseed= 1234\n# define a random generator\nrg = np.random.RandomState(seed)\n# initialize\n\n\n# generate normal random vairables\ndt= T/m\nvol=sig*np.sqrt(dt)\nincs = rg.normal(0,vol,[m,n])\n\n\ntline = np.linspace(0,T,m+1)\n\n\nSt = np.zeros((m+1,n))\n#St1 = np.zeros((m+1,n))\n\nV_vec = np.zeros((m+1,n))\n\ndelta = np.zeros((m,n))\n\nput= blackscholes(S0,K,r, q, sig,T,call=False)\n\nincs_cumsum =  np.concatenate((np.zeros((1,n)),incs),axis=0).cumsum(axis=0)\nV_vec = np.zeros((m+1,n))\nt_mat =  np.repeat(tline.reshape((m+1,1)), n, axis=1)\ndrift_cumsum = (mu -q -0.5*sig**2) * t_mat\n\nSt = S0 * np.exp(incs_cumsum + drift_cumsum)\n\ndelta = blackscholes_delta(St[:-1,:],K,r, q, sig,T-t_mat[:-1,:])\n\nV_vec[0,:] = S0 + put\n\nfor i in range(1,m+1):\n    V_vec[i,:] = V_vec[i-1,:] + (np.exp(r*dt)-1) * (V_vec[i-1,:] - delta[i-1,:] * St[i-1,:])+ delta[i-1,:] * (St[i,:]-St[i-1,:])\n\n# Uses actual simulated changes in riskfree and stock price not the dt and dB approximations \n# plot ST versus VT\nplt.scatter(St[m,:],V_vec[m,:])\nplt.xlabel('Stock Price at Maturity')\nplt.ylabel('Value of Portfolio Insurance')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](Chapter_BlackScholes_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=585 height=282}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith $m=100$ rebalancing dates over $T=0.5$ for the parameters chosen the repliacting strategy does a pretty good job.  The hedging errors occur when the stock price is close to the strike price.  This is not surprising since the delta changes (measured by the gamma) fastest around this point.  A gamma hedge would potentially improve the performance.\n\nThe portfolio insurance rebalancing scheme involves sell stock and buying bonds when the stock price goes down and buying stocks and selling bonds when the stock price goes up.  This can be destabilizing and was identified as a contributor to the 1987 stock market crash.\n\n## Greeks\n\nThe sensitivities of option values to various inputs are called Greeks. From the Black-Scholes formula:\n\n#### Delta ($\\delta$)\nThe sensitivity to stock price changes:\n\n$$\\delta_{call} = e^{-q(T-t)} N(d_1)$$\n$$\\delta_{put} = -e^{-q(T-t)} N(-d_1)$$\n\n#### Gamma ($\\Gamma$)\nThe rate of change of delta:\n\n$$\\Gamma = \\frac{e^{-q(T-t)} n(d_1)}{S \\sigma \\sqrt{T-t}}$$\n\nwhere $n(\\cdot)$ is the standard normal density. Gamma is the same for calls and puts.\n\n#### Theta ($\\Theta$)\nThe time decay (using $\\partial/\\partial(-T)$ so positive theta means value increases as time passes):\n\n$$\\Theta_{call} = -\\frac{e^{-q(T-t)} S n(d_1) \\sigma}{2\\sqrt{T-t}} + q e^{-q(T-t)} S N(d_1) - r e^{-r(T-t)} K N(d_2)$$\n\n#### Vega ($\\mathcal{V}$)\nThe sensitivity to volatility:\n\n$$\\mathcal{V} = e^{-q(T-t)} S n(d_1) \\sqrt{T-t}$$\n\n#### Rho ($\\rho$)\nThe sensitivity to interest rates:\n\n$$\\rho_{call} = (T-t) e^{-r(T-t)} K N(d_2)$$\n\n#### Interactive Greeks Explorer\n\nThe Greeks measure how option prices change with respect to various parameters.

Pay particular attention to how gamma peaks near the strike price and how theta becomes more negative as expiration approaches.\n:::\n\n## Theta and Gamma in Delta Hedges\n\nThe relationship between theta and gamma provides deep insight into option hedging. Consider a delta-hedged portfolio (short call, long $\\delta$ shares). From the fundamental PDE and our Greeks:\n\n$$\\Theta + \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma \\sigma^2 S^2 = r C - (r - q) S \\delta$$\n\nIn continuous time, the portfolio change is:\n\n$$-\\Theta \\mathrm{d}t - \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma \\sigma^2 S^2 \\mathrm{d}t + q \\delta S \\mathrm{d}t + (C - \\delta S) r \\mathrm{d}t$$\n\nThese terms exactly cancel—the time decay and dividends received offset losses from being short gamma and interest payments. This perfect cancellation only holds with continuous rebalancing.\n\nWith discrete rebalancing, the hedge is imperfect. The portfolio is short gamma, meaning it loses money when the stock moves significantly between rebalances. This loss is approximately:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma (\\Delta S)^2$$\n\nwhere $\\Delta S$ is the stock price change. The hedging error increases with:\n\n- Larger gamma (near the strike at expiration)\n- Higher volatility\n- Longer time between rebalances\n\n#### Discretely Rebalanced Delta Hedges\n\nThe theoretical analysis above assumes continuous rebalancing, but in practice, hedging must be done at discrete intervals. This introduces hedging error that we can analyze through simulation.\n\n#### The Discrete Hedging Problem\n\nConsider a delta hedge that is rebalanced at discrete times $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \\cdots < t_N = T$ with $\\Delta t = T/N$. Between rebalancing dates, the hedge portfolio consists of:\n\n- Short position in the option\n- Long $\\delta_{t_i}$ shares of stock (where $\\delta_{t_i}$ is computed at the last rebalancing date)\n- Cash position to finance the hedge\n\nThe key insight from the analysis in @sec-s_deltahedging is that perfect continuous hedging relies on the relationship:\n\n$$-\\Theta \\,\\mathrm{d} t - \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma \\sigma^2S^2\\,\\mathrm{d} t+ q \\delta S\\,\\mathrm{d} t+(C-\\delta S)r\\,\\mathrm{d} t = 0$$\n\nWith discrete rebalancing, this balance is disrupted. The portfolio gains and losses come from:\n\n1. **Time decay**: $-\\Theta \\Delta t$ (predictable, typically positive for short option)\n2. **Gamma exposure**: $-\\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma (\\Delta S)^2$ (stochastic losses when short gamma)\n3. **Interest and dividends**: Financing costs and dividend income\n4. **Delta drift**: Changes in delta between rebalancing dates\n\n#### Simulation of Discrete Hedging\n\nThe following code simulates the performance of discretely rebalanced delta hedges. It runs 10,000 simulations of a stock price path, with trading to an updated delta hedge each period.^[The implementation uses Numba JIT compilation for significant performance improvements (typically 20-100x speedup compared to pure Python loops).]\n\n::: {#13c72539 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nfrom numba import jit\n\ndef blackscholes(S0, K, r, q, sig, T, call = True):\n    '''Calculate option price using Black-Scholes formula.'''\n    d1 = (np.log(S0/K) + (r -q + sig**2/2) * T)/(sig*np.sqrt(T))\n    d2 = d1 -

Given an option's market price, we can invert the Black-Scholes formula to find the implied volatility—the $\\sigma$ that produces the observed price.\n\nImplied volatilities serve several purposes:\n\n1. **Price quotes**: Options are often quoted in terms of implied volatility\n2. **Relative value**: Comparing implied volatilities helps identify expensive or cheap options\n3. **Market views**: Implied volatilities reflect market expectations of future volatility\n\n#### The Volatility Smile\n\nIf the Black-Scholes model were perfect, all options with the same maturity would have the same implied volatility. In practice, plotting implied volatility against strike typically shows:\n\n- Higher implied volatilities for low strikes (out-of-the-money puts)\n- Lower implied volatilities near the at-the-money strike\n- Slightly increasing implied volatilities for high strikes\n\nThis \"volatility smile\" or \"smirk\" indicates that market prices reflect:\n- Fat tails: Higher probability of extreme moves than lognormal\n- Negative skewness: Larger probability of extreme downward moves\n\nThe smile has been particularly pronounced for equity index options since the 1987 crash, suggesting market participants price in crash risk.\n\n## Exercises\n\n#### Digital Options and Building Blocks\n\n::: {#exr-digital-pricing}\nConsider a cash digital option that pays $1 when $S_T > K$ and a share digital that pays $S_T$ when $S_T > K$.

While real markets violate these assumptions, the Black-Scholes framework remains the foundation for understanding option pricing and hedging.\n\n",
